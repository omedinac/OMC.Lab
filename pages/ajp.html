                I'm interested in mucosal immunology, immunometabolism, microbiota, and metabolic diseases. Much of my research is about the role of intestinal macrophages on T cell function, and the interaction with epithelial cells and microbiota.

       Immunological mechanisms of non-IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) are not well understood. Such a circumstance requires attention with the aim of discovering new biomarkers that could lead to better diagnostic assays for early treatment. Here, we sought both to investigate the mechanism that underlies non-IgE-mediated CMPA and to identify cow's milk immunoreactive proteins in a Mexican pediatric patient group (n = 34). Hence, we determined the IgE and IgG1-4 subclass antibody levels against cow's milk proteins (CMP) by ELISA. Then, we performed 2D-Immunoblots using as first antibody immunoglobulins in the patients'serum that bound specifically against CMP together with CMP enrichment by ion-exchange chromatography. Immunoreactive proteins were identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The serological test confirmed absence of specific IgE in the CMPA patients but showed significant increase in antigen-specific IgG1. Additionally, we identified 11 proteins that specifically bound to IgG1. We conclude that the detection of specific IgG1 together with an immunoproteomics approach is highly relevant to the understanding of CMPA's physiopathology and as a possible aid in making a prognosis since current evidence indicates IgG1 occurrence as an early signal of potential risk toward development of IgE-mediated food allergy. SIGNIFICANCE: Allergies are one of the most studied topics in the field of public health and novel protein allergens are found each year. Discovery of new principal and regional allergens has remarkable repercussions in precise molecular diagnostics, prognostics, and more specific immunotherapies. In this context, specific IgE is widely known to mediate physiopathology; however, allergies whose mechanism does not involve this immunoglobulin are poorly understood although their incidence has increased. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and adequate treatment are delayed with significant consequences on the health of pediatric patients. The study of type and subtypes of immunoglobulins associated with the immunoreactivity of cow's milk proteins together with an immunoproteomics approach allows better comprehension of physiopathology, brings the opportunity to discover new potential cow's milk protein allergens and may help in prognosis prediction (IgG1 occurrence as an early signal of possible risk toward development of IgE-mediated food allergy).
