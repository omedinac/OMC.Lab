### The intestinal immune system in cancer and immune regulation 

Standing at the intersection of Nutrition, Proteomics, and Immunology, our lab studies mucosal regulation in cancer, inflammation, and immunity. Intestinal immune homeostasis is maintained by a fine balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to microbiota. An extensive network of antigen presenting cells and effector cells tightly regulate these responses. We focus primarily on 1) the role of nutrition on immune responses and 2) macrophages regulation of intestinal T cells and epithelial cells, in health and disease.

Our group employs clinical interventions, immuno-proteomic, flow cytometry, proteomics and genomic methods, cell biology, biochemistry and *in vivo* models to reveal new intestinal immune regulation mechanisms.

We combine our expertise to gain novel insight on basic research questions, and we aim for translating our findings into clinical applications and therapeutic interventions to promote human health.

## [Functional foods modulating inflammation and metabolism in chronic diseases: a systematic review](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408398.2021.1875189)

Chronic diseases are responsible for approximately 71% global deaths. These are characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic alterations. "Functional foods" have been attributed with anti-inflammatory properties, demonstrated in cell lines and murine models; however, studies in humans are inconclusive. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify clinical trials that analyzed changes in inflammatory and metabolic mediators, in response to consumption of specific functional foods. A total of 3581 trials were screened and 88 were included for this review. Foods identified to regulate inflammation included cranberries, grapes, pomegranate, strawberries, wheat, whole grain products, low fat dairy products, yogurt, green tea, cardamom, turmeric, soy foods, almonds, chia seeds, flax seed, pistachios, algae oil, flaxseed oil and grape seed oil. Clinical trials that focus on a dietary pattern rich in functional foods are necessary to explore if the additive effect of these foods lead to more clinically relevant outcomes.

## [IL-36$\gamma$ is secreted through an unconventional pathway using the Gasdermin D and P2X7R membrane pores](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.979749/full)

Mucosal innate immunity functions as the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Members of the IL-1 family are key cytokines upregulated in the inflamed mucosa. Inflammatory cytokines are regulated by limiting their function and availability through their activation and secretion mechanisms. IL-1 cytokines secretion is affected by the lack of a signal peptide on their sequence, which prevents them from accessing the conventional protein secretion pathway; thus, they use unconventional protein secretion pathways. Here we show in mouse macrophages that LPS/ATP stimulation induces cytokine relocalization to the plasma membrane, and conventional secretion blockade using monensin or Brefeldin A triggers no IL-36$\gamma$ accumulation within the cell. In silico modeling indicates IL-36$\gamma$ can pass through both the P2X7R and Gasdermin D pores, and both IL-36$\gamma$, P2X7R and Gasdermin D mRNA are upregulated in inflammation; further, experimental blockade of these receptors limits IL-36$\gamma$ release. Our results demonstrate that IL-36$\gamma$ is secreted mainly by an unconventional pathway through membrane pores formed by P2X7R and Gasdermin D.
